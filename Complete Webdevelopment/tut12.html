<!-- Semantic tags

We can give meaning to our elements and help search engines or the people who analyze websites. How help can be taken from interns, like if we have a blog and we attached an element to it. Then if we get a way to tell Google search engine that we have used this tag for this purpose then our websites will be parsed in a much better way by the parsers of the search engines and our websites would be ranked very high by Google after indexing. These are used in SEO(Search Engine Optimisation) -->

<!-- Non-Semantic elements are the ones that don't tell anything about their place of use etc. Like div etc. -->
