<!--Inside the html tags there are two tags, head and body
1.Inside Head comes all the meta tags that we write in order to describe a website.
Title also comes under the Head tags and also if we are linking some other external sheet(like a css sheet)
then that also comes under head tags only.

### Metadata means a set of data to describe or give information about some other data

2.Inside Body, comes all the content that will be displayed on the web page.
