    </form>  <!--We'll use a backend here. We'll give our form to a backend. Now, if we're using php as a backend, then we'll say go to backend.php and submit this data there. This action is nothing but an endpoint where all the data of our form gets submitted.-->
</body>

<!-- Because there is no backend.php that's why it's giving an error while trying to insert the content after redirecting to backend.php. The URL contains all values : http://127.0.0.1:5501/backend.php?myName=Abhishek&myRole=Programmer&myEmail=abhishekyadav2498%40gmail.com. -->

<!--  HTML VALUE ATTRIBUTE in OPTION TAG
The value attribute specifies the value to be sent to a server when a form is submitted.

The content between the opening <option> and closing </option> tags is what the browsers will display in a drop-down list. However, the value of the value attribute is what will be sent to the server when a form is submitted.

Note: If the value attribute is not specified, the content will be passed as a value instead. -->
